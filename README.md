## About me 🙋‍♂️

Bachelor in Computer Science and Systems, with training in cybersecurity and a focus on web penetration testing. Currently preparing for the eWPTXv3 certification, enhancing my skills in advanced exploitation, control evasion, and vulnerability detection. I regularly reference the OWASP Top 10 and WSTG to guide my assessments. I'm also completing the PortSwigger labs to earn the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP) certification, further improving my proficiency with professional tools and methodologies.
