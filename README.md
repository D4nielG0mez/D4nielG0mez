## About me 🙋‍♂️

I'm a Computer Science and Systems graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity 🔐 and a focus on web penetration testing 🧪.
I'm currently preparing for the eWPTXv3 certification, enhancing my skills in advanced exploitation, control evasion, and vulnerability detection. I regularly reference the OWASP Top 10 and WSTG 📘 to guide my assessments. I'm also completing PortSwigger labs to earn the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP) 🛡️ certification.
